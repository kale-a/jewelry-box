      <div className="about-text">
        Kayla Smith, the creator and founder of Jewelry Box - a self-proclaimed 'earring addict', bore this idea to help her remember
        what earrings she had. A new season would comes about and she thought she had all of the theme-appropriate earrings at her disposal,
        only to find out two months after the season ends that she had SO many other cute pieces she had completely forgot about because
        they were packed away from her last move. Kayla tried to keep her pieces organized, but much to her chagrin, the feat was too daunting.
        <br />
        <br />
        At the time of her most futile organizing efforts, she was attending a web development bootcamp called LaunchAcademy in Boston, MA.
        One requirement for the program is to create an app or 'breakable toy' as the final project to implement what a student has learned
        during the 18 week curriculum. Thus, Jewelry Box was born and the labor of love began.
